# DeepLearning-CNNBasicsAndImageClassification
This project explores CNNs in two parts: building convolutional and pooling layers from scratch to understand their mechanics, and using Keras to implement a CNN for classifying CIFAR-10 images. The project provides hands-on learning of CNN fundamentals and experience in applying deep learning to real-world image classification tasks.
